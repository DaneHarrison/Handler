## Runtime instructions
1. Navigate to the projects directory
2. Create a virtual environment via ```python -m venv ./.env```
3. Activate virtual environment via ```.env/Scripts/activate```
4. Install dependencies via ```python -r requirements.txt```
5. Navigate to src
6. run ```python main.py```
7. **To exit the application, press *q***
    - Note that the window must be opened for the application to close

### Making changes
1. Create a new gesture:  
All new gestures should be added to the gesture folder and should implement the [gesture base class]() as well as some sort of cooldown to prevent duplicate actions

2. Adding it to HandTracker:  
The list of gestures, where new gesture should be added to, can be found in the [HandTracker]() constructor. Not that the once a gesture is detected, all other checks are abandoned. In short, **order matters**

3. Testing:  
Gestures are detected by distances between different hand points, therefore, to test which hand points are most unique to a given gesture it is useful to use the setup gesture. This option can easily be toggled through the SETUP_MODE constant  in [main]()

4. Distances:
Currently, gestures are detected based on distances between different hand points. However, these will vary between users and distances
